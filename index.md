I am currently a Postdoctoral Teaching Scholar at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Department of Economics](https://economics.nd.edu) at Notre Dame in May 2024. My research focuses on the intersection of monetary policy and economic dynamics, with an emphasis on labor markets, inflation expectations, and the extensive margin of the production sector. My Ph.D. advisors are [Eric Sims](https://sites.nd.edu/esims/) and [Jeffrey Campbell](https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/jrcampbell/home).

**I am participating in the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year.** [My Job Market Paper](/uploads/research/heterogenous_unemployment.pdf) examines the heterogeneous response of unemployment rates to unexpected expansionary monetary policy for high- and low-skilled workers using time-series analysis. I develop a New Keynesian DSGE model with asymmetric search and matching frictions, calibrated to empirical impulse responses, and find that optimal monetary policy should respond to both skill-specific unemployment and inflation due to congestion externalities in the labor market. A strong response on inflation remains optimal, while responding to output shows to reduce overall welfare. 

**I am open to opportunities** in academic research and teaching, as well as roles in research institutes, economic consulting, and government positions.

Before starting my graduate studies at Notre Dame, I was an Instructor at (The University of Georgia](https://www.ug.edu.ge/en) and [European University](https://eu.edu.ge/en), where I taught courses in Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and International Economics. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University - Policy Institute ([ISET-PI](https://www.iset-pi.ge/en?)), contributing to projects such as Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) and the Business Confidence Index. In 2017, I graduated with an M.A. in Mathematics from [Georgian Technical University](https://gtu.ge/en/), and in 2015, I earned an M.A. in Economics from the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University ([ISET](https://iset.tsu.ge/)). During my Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame, I also served as an Instructor for Managerial Economics at the Mendoza School of Business.
