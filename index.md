I am currently a Postdoctoral Teaching Scholar at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Department of Economics](https://economics.nd.edu) at Notre Dame in May 2024. My research focuses on the intersection of monetary policy and economic dynamics, with an emphasis on labor markets, inflation expectations, and the extensive margin of the production sector. My Ph.D. advisors are [Eric Sims](https://sites.nd.edu/esims/) and [Jeffrey Campbell](https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/jrcampbell/home).

**I am participating in the job market for the 2024-2025 academic year.** [My Job Market Paper](/uploads/research/heterogenous_unemployment.pdf) offers a systematic comparison of the forecasting accuracy of machine learning models in predicting U.S. macroeconomic and financial indicators. I will attend the NABE TEC 2024 job fair, and I am open to interviews for positions in the tech industry, economic consulting, and government roles.

Prior to starting my graduate studies at Notre Dame, I was a Research Associate in the [Economics area](https://www.iimb.ac.in/economics-area) at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. In May 2017, I graduated from the [Indian Statistical Institute's Delhi Center](https://www.isid.ac.in/epu/) with an M.S. in Quantitative Economics.
