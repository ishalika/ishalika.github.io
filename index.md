I am a Data Strategy Postdoctoral fellow at the [Graduate School](https://graduateschool.nd.edu/) and the [Division of Student Affairs](https://studentaffairs.nd.edu) at the University of Notre Dame. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Department of Economics](https://economics.nd.edu) at the University of Notre Dame in June 2024. My primary research interests include Applied Macroeconometrics, Time Series, and Forecasting using Machine Learning Methods. [Christiane Baumeister](https://sites.google.com/site/cjsbaumeister/home) is my Ph.D. advisor. I interned as an Economist at Amazon Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) in the summer of 2023.

**I am on the job market during the 2024-2025 academic year.** [My Job Market Paper](/uploads/Konduri_JMP.pdf) offers a systematic comparison of the forecasting accuracy of machine learning models in predicting U.S. macroeconomic and financial indicators. I will attend the NABE TEC 2024 job fair, and I am open to interviews for positions in the tech industry, economic consulting, and government roles.

In May 2017, I graduated from the [Indian Statistical Institute's Delhi Center](https://www.isid.ac.in/epu/) with an M.S. in Quantitative Economics.
