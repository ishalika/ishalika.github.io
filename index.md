I am currently a Postdoctoral Teaching Scholar at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Department of Economics](https://economics.nd.edu) at Notre Dame in May 2024. My research focuses on the intersection of monetary policy and economic dynamics, with an emphasis on labor markets, inflation expectations, and the extensive margin of the production sector. 

My Ph.D. advisors are [Eric Sims](https://sites.nd.edu/esims/), [Jeffrey R. Campbell](https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/jrcampbell/home), and [James X. Sullivan](https://sites.nd.edu/james-sullivan/).

[My Job Market Paper](/uploads/research/heterogenous_unemployment.pdf) examines the heterogeneous response of unemployment rates to unexpected expansionary monetary policy for high- and low-skilled workers using time-series analysis. I am open to opportunities in academic research and teaching, as well as roles in research institutes, economic consulting, and government positions.
