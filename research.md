## Job Market Paper

[Monetary Policy Analysis With Heterogeneous Unemployment Dynamics](/uploads/research/heterogenous_unemployment.pdf) 

**Abstract:** 

This paper investigates the heterogeneous response of unemployment rates to unexpected expansionary monetary policy for high- and low-skilled workers, using time-series analysis. I develop a New Keynesian DSGE model with asymmetric search and matching frictions, calibrated to empirical impulse responses. Motivated by these findings, I study optimal monetary policy rules in a framework with sticky prices, asymmetric matching frictions, and real wage rigidities. The results show that the optimal policy should respond to both low- and high-skill unemployment alongside inflation, as addressing the congestion externalities inherent in the labor market is crucial for reducing inefficiencies. A strong response to inflation remains optimal, while responding to output tend to reduce the welfare.

## Working Paper

[How Much Has the Fed’s New Policy Framework Contributed to Inflation?](/uploads/research/AIT.pdf) with [Dario Cardamone](https://www.dariocardamone.com/), [Victoria Consolvo](https://economics.nd.edu/people/graduate-students/victoria-consolvo/) and [Eric Sims](https://sites.nd.edu/esims/)

**Abstract:** 

We evaluate the impact of the Federal Reserve’s August 2020 change in policy framework on inflation. Using a representative agent New Keynesian model, we simulate inflationary shocks to the economy and compare the path of inflation under a standard Taylor rule (STR) to that under asymmetric output growth responses (AR) and average inflation targeting (AIT). We find that from 2020-Q3 to 2021-Q2, a policy rule with both AR and AIT generates higher inflation than the STR. After 2021, a rule with AIT alone generates lower inflation than either the STR or a rule containing both AIT and AR.

[The Borrowing Cost Channel of Monetary Transmission](/uploads/research/The_Borrowing_Cost_Channel_of_Monetary_Transmission.pdf) with [Soo Kim](https://economics.nd.edu/people/graduate-students/soo-kim/)

**Abstract:** 

This paper examines the effect of monetary policy on the extensive margin of the production sector when the borrowing cost of the firm differs by its productivity. Consistent with the literature and the empirical findings, (i) monetary policy stimulates the entry of the firms not only through the trade-off between increased demand and increased cost, but also directly through reducing the  borrowing cost. However, in the current calibration of the model, (ii) monetary policy might offset the initial increase in output through the demand channel by directly attracting less efficient firms. In contrast, a model without size dependent interest rate exhibits a pronounced output response and moderate inflation sensitivity, lacking the economic stabilization conferred by differentiated borrowing costs. Moreover, a model without size dependent interest rate and firm entry/exit mechanisms displays amplified output and inflation responses, indicative of a standard New Keynesian approach that abstracts from firm dynamics. Inclusion of size dependent borrowing costs and dynamic firm behavior in our model dampens these responses, suggesting a stabilizing effect on the economy and highlighting the transitory nature of policy impacts, which are absent in the standard framework.
