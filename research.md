## Job Market Paper

[Monetary Policy Analysis With Heterogeneous Unemployment Dynamics](/uploads/heterogenous_unemployment.pdf) 

**Abstract:** 

My Job Market Paper investigates the heterogeneous response of unemployment rates to unexpected expansionary monetary policy for high- and low-skilled workers, using time-series analysis. I develop a New Keynesian DSGE model with asymmetric search and matching frictions, calibrated to empirical impulse responses. Motivated by these findings, I study optimal monetary policy rules in a framework with sticky prices, asymmetric matching frictions, and real wage rigidities. The results show that the optimal policy should respond to both low- and high-skill unemployment alongside inflation, as addressing the congestion externalities inherent in the labor market is crucial for reducing inefficiencies. A strong response to inflation remains optimal, while responding to output is welfare detrimental.

## Working Paper

[The Role of Oil Price Shocks in Shaping Unemployment Dynamics](/uploads/Chap_Unemployment_WP.pdf)

**Abstract:** 

We utilize local projections to investigate the impact of structural oil price shocks on unemployment rates and spells across the United States, emphasizing both national and state-level variations. Oil supply shocks lead to long-run increases in the national unemployment rate, incidence, and short-term unemployment. In contrast, economic activity shocks reduce all unemployment rates and spells, especially in oil-producing states. Consumption demand shocks have minimal impact on unemployment rates and durations, while inventory demand shocks show only temporary effects on durations.

## Work In Progress

[Revisiting the Response of Monetary Policy to Oil Supply Shocks](/uploads/Chapter_MP_WP.pdf)

**Abstract:** 

The paper uses local projections to investigate the macroeconomic and monetary policy responses to adverse oil supply shocks. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates twice: on impact and ten months after the shock to counter ongoing high inflation. A net oil exporter, Canada raises interest rates sharply in response to the shock to counter inflation. Switzerland initially maintains steady interest rates to prevent Swiss Franc appreciation, followed by gradual rate increases to manage inflation as the exchange rate stabilizes. Despite these efforts, inflation remains high in Switzerland.

## Working Paper

[Firms of a Feather Merge Together: Cultural Proximity and M&A Outcomes](/uploads/mna_paper.pdf) with [Manaswini Bhalla](https://manaswinibhalla.weebly.com/), [Manisha Goel](http://manishagoel.weebly.com/) and [Michelle Zemel](https://research.pomona.edu/michelle-zemel/)

**Abstract:** 

Using data from India, we show that shared caste identities between two firms’ directors increase the likelihood of entering a merger and acquisition (M&A) deal. This may indicate directors’ reliance on caste as an informal information channel. But it may also be driven by their agency or overestimating synergies, leading to suboptimal deals. Indeed, we find that caste-proximate M&A deals create less value than caste-distant deals for both acquirer and target. The negotiation process and long-run performance also do not improve. Evidence strongly supports the presence of agency costs but not information gains or overestimation of synergies.
